# Getting Started with this Wiki App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In this case I use [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6) to comunicate the navigation in the app; [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com)
just to make it friendly ðŸ˜…  and the atomic design pattern (try to make every single tag to an atom and them to component  ðŸ¤¯).

### Notes
The PUBLIC AND PRIVATE KEYÂ´s it located in the config file (you have to use your own keis available in your [personal Marvel Account](https://developer.marvel.com/account) )

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all the dependences and resources nedded to run in localhost.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
